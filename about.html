                <h1>TECHNOSCAPE</h1>
                <p> Water, the most vital natural resource, has touched every aspect of human life. Various
                    anthropogenic activities are
                    threatening its very existence. If the judicious utilisation of remaining supplies is to be ensured,
                    it is our
                    responsibility as human beings to search for viable conservation techniques. The international
                    community has enthusiastically
                    embraced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In particular, SDG 6 has become the guiding light
                    for efforts to
                    meet the rising water demand and avert a worldwide water crisis. In tune with the United Nations'
                    goal to 'Ensure availability
                    and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all' by 2030, we at Vellore Institute of
                    Technology-Vellore, INDIA,
                    propose to host TECHNOSCAPE23, an international conference on Sustainable Technologies for Water and
                    Wastewater Treatment,
                    from 14th to 16th December 2023. TECHNOSCAPE23 aims to provide a platform for water enthusiasts and
                    environmental experts
                    to share their rich scientific experiences.</p>
