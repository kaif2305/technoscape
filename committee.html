            <h4 style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.3;"><b>Dr.G.Viswanathan</b> - Chancellor<br>
              Dr. G.V, the founder-chancellor of VIT University, was born on December 8, 1938 in a remote
              village near Vellore in Tamil Nadu. Dr. GV’s life is a source of inspiration to the aspiring
              youth.<br> <br>

              <b>Dr. G.V</b> − The Student<br>
              Dr. GV completed Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 2003, nearly four
              decades after his University education, reaffirming his fervour in being an eternal student.
              He excelled in academics right from his childhood. His early education was confined to his
              small village where he studied in Tamil - his mother tongue. His pre-university education at
              Voorhees College, Vellore initiated him to the world outside. From there he moved on to
              obtain his Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Economics from the prestigious Loyola College,
              Chennai. Following this, he graduated in Law from Madras Law College.
              <br> <br>
              <b>Dr. G.V</b> − The Leader of the People<br>
              A student leader in his twenties entering Indian parliament was something incredible,
              especially in 1960s. But it was Dr. GV who championed people’s issues in the parliament and
              they, in turn, reposed faith in the leader who fulfilled their expectations. They re-elected
              him by a bigger margin in the next election for another five-year term. He travelled to
              different parts of the world as a member of parliamentary delegations and appreciated issues
              in a global perspective. Dr. GV wanted to play a bigger role in the provincial politics in
              order to make a direct contribution in bettering the lives of the people in the region. He
              was elected to Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly for ten years. During this period, he served
              as a Minister for two years.<br> <br>

              <b>Dr. G.V</b> − The Educator <br>
              Dr. G. Viswanathan founded Vellore Engineering College in 1984 at Vellore. He envisioned
              that this Institution would offer World-Class Education to students who would in turn create
              an indelible impact on the society. The engineering college that started with an intake of
              180 students in 1984 has evolved as a university with four campuses. Over 25,000 students
              are enrolled in 51 undergraduate and 33 Postgraduate, 11 Integrated, 2 Research programmes
              and 2 M.Tech Industrial Programmes with nearly 16,000 residing on the campus. It attracts
              students and professors from different parts of the world. It houses more than 1000
              international students on campus. For the past two years, VIT University has been ranked #1
              private engineering institution in India. ISO Certification from Holland, International
              accreditation from the United Kingdom and USA, and the highest accreditation grade from the
              Government of India reflect the University’s penchant for excellence on all fronts.
              <br> <br>
              <b>Dr. G.V</b> − The Institution <br>
              Due to his passion for societal development and compassion for the underprivileged, Dr. GV
              has launched several schemes for uplifting the women and unemployed youth in the region to
              help them become self-reliant. He offers scholarships to students from disadvantaged
              sections of the society to enable them to pursue higher education. He has established the
              Universal Higher Education Trust to create opportunities for higher education to every
              deserving student in the region. He has adopted several villages with the motto of improving
              the quality of lives of the rural people. His vision of transforming Vellore into a greener
              and cooler town by planting one million saplings has begun to yield fruit. Dr.GV’s
              farsightedness extends beyond horizons.

              Vellore Engineering College to VIT University in 2001, and became its first Pro-Chancellor.
              Mr. Selvam enjoys the distinction of being the youngest Pro-Chancellor of a University in
              the world, which has been recognized by the Limca Book of Records, 2005. He holds a
              postgraduate degree in Business Administration from University of Madras. Mr. Selvam became
              the first Vice-President of VIT Chennai in 2010, where he sculptured the campus from the
              scratch. The high rise structures, the lush green ambience and the ultra-modern
              infrastructure that adorn VIT Chennai were created within a short span of time under his
              able leadership. He has developed VIT Chennai campus in conformity with the standards of the
              Green LEED certification. As the Vice President, he continues to contribute diligently to
              its growth. His painstaking efforts in implementing several innovative measures have enabled
              VIT to emerge as an institution of international eminence. A self-motivated and industrious
              person, and a farsighted educationalist, Mr. G.V. Selvam possesses an innate ability to spot
              and nurture talent–be it with the faculty, staff or students. He offers flexible and
              pragmatic academic solutions not only for toppers but also for slow learners. Mr. Selvam was
              instrumental in introducing new and need-based programmes of study such as Law,
              Architecture, Hotel Management and Agriculture. He introduced the inter-university sports &
              cultural extravaganza, “Riviera”, which has blossomed into an acclaimed international event.
              He played a significant role in establishing the VIT Technology Business Incubator (VITTBI),
              which has received national acclaim for its service to budding entrepreneurs. The Centre for
              Sustainable Rural Development and Research Studies [CSRD&RS] is the brainchild of Mr.
              Selvam. The centre is working towards providing urban facilities in rural areas to enhance
              the living conditions in villages, which would develop the rural folk on par with the urban
              people in terms of education and employability. A man with a deep passion for nature, Mr. G
              V Selvam takes immense interest in green initiatives. The lush green, self-sustaining, VIT
              campuses in Vellore and Chennai are examples of his efforts to adorn the spaces with natural
              beauty. He is the brain behind the Green Vellore Project, which has added green cover to the
              rocky and barren landscape of Vellore, and the Clean Palar Project, which is taking measures
              to restore the Palar river bed to its original texture. He is passionate about transforming
              Vellore into a clean, green and nature-rich city. Mr. Selvam is inspired and guided by Dr.
              APJ Abdul Kalam’s principle: “A leader must have vision and passion, and not be afraid of
              any problem. Instead, he should know how to defeat it. Most importantly, he must work with
              integrity.”
